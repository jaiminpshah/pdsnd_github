### Project Title
Bikeshare Statistics

This project will uncover bike share usage patterns for many major cities in the United States. It will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The project will provide the detail below:
#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time
#4 User info

This project also prompts the user whether they would like want to see the raw data. If the user answers 'yes,' then the script should print 5 rows of the data at a time, then ask the user if they would like to see 5 more rows of the data. The script should continue prompting and printing the next 5 rows at a time until the user chooses 'no,' they do not want any more raw data to be displayed.
